1)Everything in Linux is treated as a File
2)Entire Linux File System follows a Tree Structure
   Directory means Folder

   root directory(/) is the parent directory of all the folders
   Under Root Directory we have Multiple directories... one among them is the Home directory
   Home Directory has directory for each of the users on the system

   In the Tree Structure
   -Everything below a particular user is specific to that user
   -Everything above it is specific to the System
   -Hence System related files require special permission/ privileges...
    these files are only accessible to the root user
