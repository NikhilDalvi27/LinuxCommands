1) Create a File
    use the touch command
    eg: touch fileName
    file can even be created in another directory

2) Create a File with some content
    use echo command
    eg: echo "hello" > hello.txt


3) Create a Directory(Folder)
    use the mkdir command
    eg : mkdir folderName
    Folder can even be created in another directory

    IMP If you want to create a Folder inside folder use the p option
    eg : mkdir  -p bla/thing/sdhfja
        this will create the entire path


4) Creating Directories in Bulk..  this is called brace expansion
    mkdir {jan,feb,mar,apr,may,jun,jul,aug,sep,oct,nov,dec}_{2017..2022}

5)Creating files in Bulk
    touch {jan,feb,mar,apr,may,jun,jul,aug,sep,oct,nov,dec}_{2017..2022}/file{1..100}
    touch file{A,B,C}.txt


6)Delete a file
    rm fileName     .. if in the same directory
    rm pathName     ....if inside other directory

7)Delete a folder
    rm -r folderName/       .....(Be careful) r commands stands for recursively delete everything inside it
    rm -ri folderName       ... i stands for interactive ...use it just to safe delete

    rmdir  folderName/*     ...it will only delete the folders which are empty....so SAFEST to use
                               ... however * is necessary to be mentioned


8)Copy a File
    cp source.txt  destination.txt
    cp  source1.txt source2.txt  destinationFolder/     ..last thing that comes is the destination
                                                        ..everything else is the source

    cp -r copy_me/  destination/        ...copies the entire copy_me folder into the destination folder
                                         .. it's bcoz we are using the -r command


9)Rename a File or a Folder
    mv oldName.txt  newName.txt
    mv  oldFolder/  newFolder

10) For Moving Files
    mv  originalFolder/*  .       (move everything from originalFolder to pwd)


11)For editing files
    nano                    (Gives a text editor)


12)For Locating Files
    locate  *.conf          (locates only the Files that end with the .conf extension)
                               (sudo updatedb .... before using the locate command)
                                (locate command doesn't work on Folders)


13) Find command
    find  /etc              (etc is the path mentioned)
                            (locates the Files as well as the Folders)
                           (doesn't need a DB to work)




14)Search a File
    grep  e    hello.txt              (used for regex match...find the letter e)

    grep -v e   hello.txt               (find lines that don't have e in them)

    grep -cv    e hello.txt             (to count the lines as well)
