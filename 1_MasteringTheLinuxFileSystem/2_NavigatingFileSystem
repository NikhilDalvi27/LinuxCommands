1) ~ Means CURRENT USERS home directory
   root directory(/) is the parent directory of all the folders

2) pwd stands for print working directory
        tells the folder our shell is currently operating in
3) Note ls does not accept standard input while piping
        it needs the xargs command to convert standard input to command Line arguments

4) ls will list out the folders in current directory
        here BLUE indicates Folders and Folder Names end with /
        WHITE indicates Files
5) ls - F
       It classifies everything into Files or Folders

6) ls -l
        This puts everything in long form format

   ls -a
        Will list out all the files...also the hidden ones
        in the current directory

        In this (.) Folder refers to the current directory
        and (..) Folder refers to the parent

7) cd  FolderName
        This changes the current Directory

        eg:
            This is absolute path -- both do the same thing
             cd /home/nikhil/Downloads  NOTE here the entire path is specified at once and not stepwise
             cd ~/Downloads

             This is relative path
             cd Downloads

             cd .. will take you to the parent of the current directory


    Note only typing cd without any inputs takes you to the current user's homeDirectory
