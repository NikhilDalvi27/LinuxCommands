Archive meaning
-transfer (data) to a less frequently used storage medium such as magnetic tape.

Tar ball like a Container where we put the files
so that it's easy for us to compress those files...by compressing the tar ball using compression algorithm

1) Make a tarball   (Just a container to store files)
2) Compress the tarball using compression algorithm


Tar command

1) to create a tarball

tar -cvf    newArchiveName.tar  file[1-3].txt
                    |                   |
            (new Archive Name)  (what files are to
                                  be compressed)

    c option-- create a new archive
    v option--  verbose meaning, report what is done
    f  option-- accept files


1.1)IMP to create a tarball and compress at the same time

tar -cvzf    newArchiveName.tar.gz  file[1-3].txt




2)to look what's inside the tarball

tar -tf  newArchiveName.tar

    t option -- test label, let u check what's inside the tar file


3) to extract the files from tarball

tar -xvf  newArchiveName.tar

    x option-- extract the file

 (Note even after extracting the tar ball is still valid)


3.1)IMP  to extract directly from Compressed

tar -xvzf  newArchiveName.tar.gz





 COMPRESSION

2 Algorithms

gzip -- faster but less compression power(doesn't reduce the size significantly)
bzip2 -- slower but more compression power


1) To Compress
eg  gzip newArchiveName.tar


2)To UnCompress (reverse compression)
eg   gunzip newArchiveName.tar.gz



Creating Zip files

1) zip command

zip  zipFolderName.zip file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt

2) unzip command

unzip   zipFolderName.zip
