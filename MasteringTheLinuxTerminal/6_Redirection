Redirection allows us to control the Flow of Data Stream

To redirect the Standard Output (Name of the Stream where the Output Goes...
								Not the destination but the Pipe/Stream )
from Terminal to SomeWhere Else

Every Stream has a Number associated with it 
Following are the Data Streams

-> Standard Input is 0
-> Standard Output is 1
-> Standard Error is 2

By Default all of them point to(End at) Terminal


(Here we are changing the destination 
of stream number 1)


Note always use >>  so that the Data is Appended
			if	>  used then it will overwrite the data


1) StandardInput
	
	cat < input.txt

	Note that we can use input from one file and Output it to Other
	eg: cat < input.txt  >> hello.txt


2) StandardOutput

	cat 1> output.txt  (Here the number 1 is optional)

	Note that cat first truncates all the data if the file is already present
	and then it writes to it
	Inorder to APPEND to the Previous content use >>

	cat >> output.txt	(for Appending)


3) StandardError

	cat -k sdjfk  2>> error.txt

	(Here 2 is Mandatory)
	(Redirecting the standardError stream from terminal to error.txt )


NOTE : Both StandardOutput and StandardError can be used at the SAME TIME
