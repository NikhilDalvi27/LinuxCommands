Link the commands to create a COMMAND PIPELINE
using DataStream we can do Piping and Redirection

1)  2 ways to get data into a Command
		a) Standard Input   (DataStream)
		b) Command Line Arguments

	2 ways to get data out
		a) Standard Output  (DataStream)
		b) Standard Error   (DataStream)



2) IMP  DataStream can be re-directed from their default location
  to wherever you wish...this is a process called Redirection

  Standard Output and Standard Error leads to the terminal
  Standard Input is connected to the Keyboard


3) We can Redirect the Standard Output of one Command
   to Standard Input of another
   This process is called Piping


CommandLine args can not be Redirected
since CommandLine args are associated with a particular command or a option
eg cal  -A 1 12 2017
here -A ...is the After option and 1 is the commandline arg associated with it
