	-All commands are some computer programs that are installed on the computer on a specific path
	eg usr/bin
	the pathname can be found out using  "which" command

	1)Command or (ProgramName) that you have to use 
	  is always the first part of the command

	VERY IMP- Command Structure

     -> COMMANDNAME -OPTIONS INPUTS


     	a)Commands operate on inputs
     	b)Options modify a Commands behaviour

       (Same Command can be customized using different Options and different Inputs )
       (Inputs are also called Operand...Some commands require Inputs, Some Don't)
       (There can be one or more Inputs --Operands)
       eg: cal
       	   cal 2021
       	   cal 12 2021

       	   date
       	   date -u
       	   date --universal	(Same as above,just have to proceed with --)
                             (some options don't have long forms...only short form)

       	   NOTE:- Long Names are proceeded by 2 dashes 
       	    	  and Usually follow Pascal Case(Seperated by dash)
       	   		  and short Names are proceeded by 1 dash

       	  
       	   IMP For supplying different options u can do either of the following
       	   1)date -a -b -c -d -e (NOTE : here the Order does not matter)
       	   2)date -abcde	(NOTE : This type of chaining is not possible with LongForms)
       	   

    
    2)Some Commands allow = sign to match the Options with the corresponding Inputs
     
       -> COMMANDNAME  -OPTIONS=INPUTS


    3)Some Commands are not listed using man ....for those commands use cd


    3)To print the path in which the commands lies, this is just to ensure if the 
     command lies on the shell path

    -> which commandName
