Note -> Redirection is processed before piping,
        so once you do re-direction you cannot do piping


Piping -> It's about connecting the standard output of one command
		  to the standard input of another command

For the Commands that don't even accept standard input
so as to be used in piping
so XARGS command is used to convert the Standard Input into Command Line Argument
eg: date | xargs echo


-> Redirection of STDOUT breaks pipeline
-> To Save Data without breaking pipeline, use TEE command
-> If Command doesn't accept STDIN, but u want to pipe it, use XARGS
-> Commands that we use with XARGS can still have their	own argument





eg: date | cut --delimiter " " --fields=1  > today.txt
	
	Here the output of date command is given as an input to the cut command
	Using the | (pipe operator)





IMP NOTE -> Once you do redirection you cannot do anymore piping		  
			When you want to continue piping after redirection
			Use the TEE command


			date |  tee fulldate.txt 			| cut --delimiter " " --fields=1 			

					(Note we took 						Here the piping continues
					SnapShot and continue
					doing piping)
					Since we are redirecting
					Stream to fulldate.txt

Data Flow (Tee Command)  -  - - >
					        |
					        V
IMP

1) Tee Command --(Basically used for Saving Data in Between the Pipeline)


	We redirect the Output Of previous command into 2 Data Streams

	eg: date | tee fulldate.txt | cut --delimiter " " --fields 1> today.txt

	(The tee command will only operate on the Output Data which is 
	 preceeding it eg: date command    and not the one which is behind it)


2) XARGS Command --(Piping connects Standard Output of one command to Standard Input of Other
					But Some command do not accept the Standard Input but Command Line Args, 
					So XARGS converts the Standard Input to Command Line Args)


		eg: date | echo		-- This thing doesn't work
								Since echo doesn't accept Standard Input but only Command Line Arguments


		a) date | xargs echo "hello"   -- This thing works					

		b) cat filestodelete.txt | xargs rm
