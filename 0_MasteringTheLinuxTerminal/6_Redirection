Redirection allows us to control the Flow of Data Stream
in other words where the Data Stream(pipe) points(ends)

To redirect the Standard Output (Name of the Stream where the Output Goes...
								Not the destination but the Pipe/Stream )
from Terminal to SomeWhere Else




Every Stream has a Number associated with it 
Following are the Data Streams

-> Standard Input is 0
-> Standard Output is 1
-> Standard Error is 2

By Default all of them point to(End at) Terminal


(Here we are changing the destination 
of stream number 1)


Note always use >>  so that the Data is Appended
			if	>  used then it will overwrite the data

we can use both at a time
cat 1>> output.txt 2>>  error.txt


1) StandardInput
	
	cat < input.txt

	Note that we can use input from one file and Output it to Other
	eg: cat < input.txt  >> hello.txt


2) StandardOutput

	cat 1> output.txt  (Here the number 1 is optional)

	Note that cat first truncates all the data if the file is already present
	and then it writes to it
	Inorder to APPEND to the Previous content use >>

	cat >> output.txt	(for Appending)


3) StandardError

	cat -k sdjfk  2>> error.txt

	(Here 2 is Mandatory)
	(Redirecting the standardError stream from terminal to error.txt )


NOTE : Both StandardOutput and StandardError can be used at the SAME TIME
